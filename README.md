## Note:

Due to some personal reasons, I was not able to complete the given assessment within the time frame.

- I have implemented Amazon-like product listing page that shows data from the API along with Price and ratings in UI
- I have created the Amazon-like product details page that is shown whenever a prodcut is clicked on the listing page. This page shows the description and category of the product.
- I have also implemented the local storage for storing cart that has id and quanity data, and will update accordingly.
- Rest features are not implemented yet.


## Run the project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
### `npm start`
